//! ## hc_zome_profiles_integrity
//!
//! Profiles zome for any Holochain app.
//!
//! If you need to manage profiles (nickname, name, avatar, age and other useful personal information)
//! you can directly include this zome and its coordinator counterpart [hc_zome_profiles_coordinator](https://docs.rs/hc_zome_profiles_coordinator) in your DNA.
//!
//! Read about how to include both this zome and its frontend module in your application [here](https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/profiles).
